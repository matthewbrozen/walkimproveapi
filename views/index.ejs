    <h1>WalkImprove API</h1>
    <p>Welcome to WalkImprove's RESTful API, this API stores reports of poor sidewalks. The fields of the reports are; the intersection, the direction of the sidewalk, and details about the sidewalk condition. All the fields are of type string and the id's are generated by mongoDB. A good idea is to Get all reports and then you have a list of the id's to use for any actions you want to perform on the API.  </p>
    <h2>RESTful Routes</h2>
    <h4> Get all reports GET /reports </h4>
